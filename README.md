# CHLandsat8
The CHLandsat 8 high-resolution Cloud detection dataset contains 64 full scenes and hand-annotated cloud masks collected by Landsat 8 satellites from different regions of China from January to December 2021.

The CHLandsat-8 dataset includes 64 full scenes collected by Landsat-8 satellites from different regions of China from January 2021 to December 2021 with high-resolution remote sensing images. CHLandsat-8 is probably the first remote sensing image cloud detection dataset collected from Landsat-8 satellites in China. Moreover, the scenes in CHLandsat-8 are more complex and diverse than previous datasets, making it more challenging to achieve high accuracy cloud detection. The dataset covers the Northwest, North, Qinghai-Tibet, and South regions of China and contains a variety of land cover types including urban, snow and ice, grassland, mountain, forest, ocean, and desert. The dataset is a preview map of remotely sensed images with dimensions of 8000×8000×3 approximately. In addition, the reference cloud Mask for the dataset has been annotated and is available online. Surely the open-sourced CHLandsat-8 dataset helps to promote the research on cloud detection.

In the process of building the dataset, the experts manually mark the position of the cloud in the image pixel by pixel. Meanwhile, the reference Mask is created by marking the pixel values of the cloud and the background with 1 and 0 respectively. The reference Mask has been iteratively checked and corrected to ensure the accuracy of the labels. In this work,44 images are randomly selected from the dataset as the training set named CHLandsat-8-TR and the rest of 20 images are used as the test set named CHLandsat-8-TE.
